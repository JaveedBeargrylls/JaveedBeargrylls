ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Javeed D
ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m deeply interested in Full-Stack Development, AI, Machine Learning, and Data Analysis.
ðŸŒ± Currently, Iâ€™m learning more about Data Visualization and AI to enhance my skills and dive deeper into the world of artificial intelligence.
ðŸ’» My tech stack includes Angular, Java, Spring Boot, Python, PostgreSQL, SQL, and tools like ActiveMQ, Infinispan, and JBoss.
ðŸš€ I enjoy working on both front-end and back-end systems, focusing on making software efficient and responsive.
ðŸŽ® When Iâ€™m not coding, you can find me gaming, hitting the gym, or indulging in some peaceful planting. Iâ€™m also a huge anime and manga fan, always seeking inspiration from the stories I watch and read.
ðŸ’¬ If you're into cloud computing, AI, or just passionate about development, feel free to reach out and let's discuss!
